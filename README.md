### 1. Explicit Animations

Learn how to create explicit animations in SwiftUI, where you have fine-grained control over the animation parameters.

### 2. Implicit Animations

Explore implicit animations, a simpler way to animate changes to your views without specifying explicit animation properties.

### 3. Transition Animations

Discover transition animations, allowing smooth transitions when adding or removing views within your interface.

### 4. Ease Functions

Understand the concept of ease functions or timing curves, which dictate how animations progress over time.



### 5. Interactive Animations

Dive into interactive animations, where user interactions such as taps, swipes, and drags trigger dynamic animations.

### 6. Delays in Animations

Learn to introduce delays into animations, controlling when animations start relative to other actions or animations.

### 7. Sequencing Animations

Master the art of sequencing animations, ensuring they start or complete in a specific order to achieve desired effects.
